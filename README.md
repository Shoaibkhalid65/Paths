# 🌀 Jetpack Compose Path API & Animation Playground

This project showcases an in-depth exploration of the **Path API**, **Canvas drawing**, and **path-based animations** in **Jetpack Compose**. It covers everything from basic drawing primitives to advanced animation techniques like path morphing, scaling, movement along paths, and visual effects using `PathEffect`.

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✍️ Custom shapes drawn using the `Path` and `DrawScope`
- 📐 Integration with SVG `pathData` for complex vector paths
- 🌀 Path-based animations using `Animatable`, `LaunchedEffect`, and motion progress
- 🎨 Gradient fills, clipping, and advanced visuals with `Brush` and `PathEffect`
- ✨ Dynamic path effects like dashed lines, corner rounding, and stamping
- 🧠 Clean and readable Composables designed for learning and reusability
